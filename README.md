# yes, it is emem's network analyzer. my baby!

okay, back to why i am doing this. this is actually a tool to help me with capturing and analyzing network packets. good thing is that i did it in a way that it supports inspecting different types of network protocols and even analyzing traffic patterns too. crazy stuff!

if you intend to use this with me, keep in mind it can do these three things mostly:

sudo ./emem_network_analyzer
